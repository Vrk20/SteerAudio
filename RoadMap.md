# Media Control App Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the weekly development plan for the Media Control App. The main feature of the app is to allow users to control audio output across different media apps and devices.

---

## **Phase 1: Requirements Gathering and Design** (Week 1)

### Objective:
Define app features, functionality, and design.

### Tasks:
- Finalize the app's core features and user experience.
- Create wireframes or mockups for the UI.
- Define user flows and interactions.

### Deliverables:
- UI mockups or wireframes.
- Documented user flows.

---

## **Phase 2: Setting Up Flutter Environment and Basic UI** (Week 2)

### Objective:
Set up the Flutter environment and build the initial UI.

### Tasks:
- Set up the Flutter project and dependencies.
- Implement a UI to display the list of currently playing media.
- Create components for audio output selection.

### Deliverables:
- Basic Flutter app with initial UI.
- UI components for media listing and audio output options.

---

## **Phase 3: Implementing Permissions and Basic Audio Management** (Weeks 3-4)

### Objective:
Handle necessary permissions and implement basic audio output management.

### Tasks:
- Integrate the `permission_handler` package for requesting permissions (Bluetooth, notification access).
- Set up basic native Android code to handle audio output routing.
- Ensure users can choose audio output devices (e.g., Bluetooth, speaker).

### Deliverables:
- Permission handling for audio management.
- Basic audio routing functionality in native Android.

---

## **Phase 4: Advanced Audio Routing Logic** (Weeks 5-7)

### Objective:
Implement advanced features for audio routing between different apps and output devices.

### Tasks:
- Write native code to detect currently playing media apps.
- Create logic to route audio from different apps to selected audio devices.
- Handle edge cases, such as switching audio outputs or media apps.

### Deliverables:
- Full audio routing functionality.
- Error handling for audio device management.

---

## **Phase 5: Testing and Debugging** (Weeks 8-9)

### Objective:
Ensure the app functions as expected and is free of critical bugs.

### Tasks:
- Perform unit tests and integration tests.
- Gather feedback from testers and resolve any issues.
- Test all user flows, including permission management and audio output switching.

### Deliverables:
- Tested app with minimal bugs.
- User feedback incorporated into improvements.

---

## **Phase 6: Final Enhancements and Deployment** (Week 10)

### Objective:
Polish the app and prepare it for release on the Play Store.

### Tasks:
- Implement any final features or enhancements.
- Ensure the app is stable and performant.
- Prepare the app for Play Store submission (icons, screenshots, etc.).

### Deliverables:
- Final version of the app ready for release.
- Documentation or user guide for the app.
